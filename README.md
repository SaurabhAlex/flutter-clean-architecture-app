# flutter_clean_architecture_app using **Riverpod**:

A production-ready Flutter application demonstrating **Clean Architecture** with **Riverpod** state management. The project focuses on scalability, testability, and clear separation of concerns between presentation, domain, and data layers.

## Architecture

This project follows Clean Architecture:

```
lib/
 ├─ presentation/   # UI + Riverpod providers
 ├─ domain/         # Entities note usecases & repositories
 ├─ data/           # API, models, repository implementations
```
